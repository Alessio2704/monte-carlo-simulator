**A high-performance, multithreaded C++ engine for quantitative financial modeling, driven by ValuaScript‚Äîa simple, dedicated scripting language.**

## üìñ About The Project

This project was born from the need to bridge the gap between the intuitive but slow nature of spreadsheet-based financial modeling and the powerful but often verbose nature of general-purpose programming languages. The goal is to provide a platform that offers the **usability** of a dedicated modeling language with the **raw performance** of compiled, multithreaded C++.

It is designed to execute complex, multi-year, stochastic financial models, running hundreds of thousands of Monte Carlo simulations in seconds‚Äîa task that would take minutes or hours in traditional tools.

### Key Features

- **‚ú® Simple & Intuitive Language:** Models are defined in **ValuaScript (`.vs`)**, a clean, declarative language designed specifically for finance.
- **üöÄ High-Performance Backend:** A core engine written in modern C++17, fully multithreaded to leverage all available CPU cores for maximum simulation speed.
- **üêç Smart Python Compiler**: A robust compiler, vsc, transpiles ValuaScript into a JSON recipe, providing clear, semantic error-checking before execution
- **üé≤ Integrated Monte Carlo Simulation:** Natively supports a rich library of statistical distributions (`Normal`, `Pert`, `Lognormal`, etc.) for any input variable.
- **üìà Time-Series Aware:** Built from the ground up to handle multi-year forecasts, with operations for growth series, NPV, and element-wise vector math.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Robust & Tested:** Comprehensive unit test suite built using GoogleTest, ensuring the correctness of all C++ engine features.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is built on a clean, three-layer architecture that separates human-readable modeling from high-speed computation.

```

1.  **ValuaScript (Frontend):** A user defines their model in a simple `.vs` file.
2.  **`vsc` Compiler (Middleware):** The Python-based `vsc` tool reads the `.vs` file, validates its logic, and transpiles it into a structured JSON "recipe."
3.  **Simulation Engine (Backend):** The multithreaded C++ `monte-carlo-simulator` executable reads the JSON recipe and acts as a high-speed "interpreter" to run the simulation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two paths to using this project: as an **End-User** (recommended for most) or as a **Developer** (if you want to contribute).

### For End-Users (The Easy Way)

This path allows you to write models and run simulations without setting up a Python environment.

1.  **Download the `vsc` Compiler:**
    Go to the [**latest GitHub Release**](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases) and download the `vsc` executable for your operating system.

2.  **Build the C++ Engine:**
    You only need to do this once. First, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and a [C++17 compiler](#-prerequisites) installed.

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/Alessio2704/monte-carlo-simulator
    cd monte-carlo-simulator

    # Configure and build the C++ engine
    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build
    ```

    This creates the `monte-carlo-simulator` executable inside the `build/bin/` directory.

### Full Workflow Example

With the setup complete, you can now write, compile, and run models.

1.  **Write a model** in a file named `my_model.vs`.
2.  **Compile it** using the `vsc` executable you downloaded:
    ```bash
    # This creates my_model.json
    /path/to/downloaded/vsc my_model.vs
    ```
3.  **Run the simulation** with the C++ engine:
    ```bash
    ./build/bin/monte-carlo-simulator my_model.json
    ```

#### üìã Prerequisites

- **Git:** To clone the repository.

- **Python (3.7+):** To build and run the `vsc` compiler from source.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alessio2704/monte-carlo-simulator
    monte-carlo-simulator
    ```
2.  **Build the C++ Engine:**
    ```bash
    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build
    ```
3.  **Build and Install the `vsc` Compiler:**
    ```bash

    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Install in editable mode
    pip install -e .
    ```
    The `vsc` command is now available in your shell as long as the virtual environment is active.

## üìú ValuaScript Language Guide

ValuaScript uses a simple, line-by-line syntax for defining variables and calculations.

#### Settings

Special directives configure the simulation. They are required.

```valuascript
@iterations = 100000
# ... model logic ...
@output = final_share_price
```

#### Variable Assignment (`let`)

Use the `let` keyword to define inputs and calculations.

**1. Fixed Values (Scalars and Vectors)**

```valuascript
let tax_rate = 0.21
let margin_forecast = [0.25, 0.26, 0.27, 0.28, 0.29]
```

**2. Stochastic Variables (Distributions)**

```valuascript
let growth_rate = Normal(0.08, 0.02)
let wacc = Pert(0.08, 0.09, 0.10)
```

_Supported Distributions:_ `Normal`, `Pert`, `Uniform`, `Lognormal`, `Triangular`, `Bernoulli`, `Beta`.

**3. Operations (Calculations)**
Operations are performed using functions. Expressions can be nested.

```valuascript
# Simple arithmetic
let total_capital = add(market_cap_equity, debt)

# Nested expression
let nopat = multiply(EBIT, subtract(1, tax_rate))

# Time-series functions
let revenue_series = grow_series(base_revenue, growth_rate, 10)
let terminal_value = npv(wacc, cash_flows)
```
